# Participant Notes

## Pilot
Four participants were run in a small pilot. This differed from the final
experiment in that the left index finger was used to indicate 1 stream responses
and the right was used to indicate 2 stream responses.

* Zarin
* Karli
* David
* Abin

## Study 1
The first study uses the `program/run_aba.jl` script.

Notes on participants:

**BEFORE 1101** Several RAs were more informally tested on the study, and
their files are listed by name. This version of the study turned into the final
version, and so there data is currently included in analyses.

**1104 Onwards** We had growing concerns about the instructions and examples
we were using. At this point we revised the examples to make the "splitting"
example split more readily, and this seems to have addressed the many confused,
skeptical and/or uncertain looks we were getting from participants. This
also seems to have reduced the number of participants who respond with
stream-1 resposnes only.

* 1104 - had a weave on and not sure if understood instructions properly and
  only reported 1 stream
* 1105 - clearly understood instructions but only reported 18 switches
* Jessica - ICA reveals large artifacts on right frontal electrodes /...
  and she only got sleep for one hour the previous night ... Alpha
* 1107 - they only responded 1 stream

**BEFORE 1108** - no participants before this were run on the qualtrics survey,
just the initial screener, becuase it took us up to the 2 hour mark to finish
these participants (and that's the time we had alloted for them). Participants
 past 1107 took this survey.

* 1108 - very frequent drift... data is messy  

**1108 - 1114** These participants were collected near the end of the second
semester. We suspect a lot of these participants were somewhat sleep deprived
due to the approach of finals.
